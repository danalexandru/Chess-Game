# Chess-Game
This is a game developed in python (the code is very much inspired from "techwithtim".

This repository will work alongside "Robotic-Arm-Server". The purpose of the entire project is to make a graphical interface that will allow a robotic arm controlled via raspberry pi to mimic the chess moves made in the graphical interface in real life.

The comunication between the PC and raspberry pi will be made via REST API (the server will be made using cherrypy). 
The graphical interface is implemented via pygame.
